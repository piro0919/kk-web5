Starting tomorrow, probably.

From now on, I’ll be posting technical content here on this blog, and more reflective or personal thoughts on note.

I’ve been debating for a while whether I should separate the two, but I figured I’d just give it a shot.

If it doesn’t work out, I’ll switch back. Whatever happens, que sera, sera.
